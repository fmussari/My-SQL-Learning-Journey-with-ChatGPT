### Another Prompt
I started a new conversation and used a simpler prompt. For readability I added `<br> -` at the begining of each topic inside the table.

Certainly! Here's a table outlining different topics related to SQL, arranged in order from beginner to expert level:

| Skill Level | SQL Topics |
| --- | --- |
| Beginner | - Data Definition Language (DDL) commands (CREATE, ALTER, DROP) to create and modify tables and databases<br> - Data Manipulation Language (DML) commands (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) to retrieve, add, modify, and delete data<br> - Basic filtering and sorting of data using WHERE, ORDER BY, and GROUP BY clauses<br> - Joins to combine data from multiple tables<br> - Subqueries to retrieve data from nested queries |
| Intermediate | - Advanced filtering using logical operators and wildcards<br> - Using aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG, MAX, MIN) to calculate summary statistics<br> - Working with complex data types such as dates, times, and strings<br> - Using stored procedures, functions, and triggers to automate tasks and improve performance<br> - Using transactions to ensure data integrity<br> - Performance tuning and optimization techniques |
| Advanced | - Working with multiple databases and database systems<br> - Creating and managing indexes to improve query performance<br> - Working with views to simplify queries and improve security<br> - Using window functions to perform advanced analytical operations<br> - Using Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for recursive queries and complex subqueries<br> - Understanding and using advanced optimization techniques such as query hints and indexing strategies. |

Keep in mind that this is just a rough outline, and the actual topics you need to learn will depend on your specific goals and the particular database management system you're working with. However, mastering these skills will provide a strong foundation for working with SQL databases.
