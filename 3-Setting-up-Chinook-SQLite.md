## 3. Setting up Chinook SQLite

I thought one of the easiest ways to start learning SQL is using SQLite. Let's see what does ChatGPT has to say about that.

### 3.1 Why SQLite?

Sure! Here's a brief introduction to some of the advantages of learning SQL using SQLite:

1. Free and open source: SQLite is a free and open source relational database management system. This means that you don't have to pay anything to use it, and you can also modify the source code to suit your needs. This makes it an ideal choice for small projects, learning SQL, and prototyping.

2. Lightweight and portable: SQLite is a lightweight database system that can be run on a wide variety of platforms, including Windows, Mac, Linux, and mobile devices. Its small size and portability make it a great choice for applications that need to run on devices with limited resources.

3. Simple and easy to use: SQLite has a simple and easy-to-use syntax that is similar to other SQL database systems. This means that once you learn SQL using SQLite, you'll be able to apply your skills to other relational database management systems like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server.

4. Support for standard SQL features: SQLite supports most of the standard SQL features, including transactions, triggers, views, and subqueries. This means that you can use SQLite to learn and practice advanced SQL techniques that are used in larger database systems.

5. Large user community and resources: SQLite has a large and active user community, which means that there are many resources available online to help you learn SQL using SQLite. These resources include tutorials, books, videos, and online communities where you can ask questions and get help from other users.

Overall, learning SQL using SQLite can be a great way to get started with relational database management systems. It's free, lightweight, easy to use, and supports most of the standard SQL features. Plus, there's a large and active user community that can help you along the way.

### 3.2 Setting up Chinook Database?

All right, before we start to learn sql. I want a chapter explaining how to download SQLite chinook database

Sure, here's a quick guide on how to download the SQLite Chinook database:

1. Go to the Chinook Database GitHub repository at https://github.com/lerocha/chinook-database.

2. <s>Scroll down to the "Chinook Database" section and click on the "chinook.sqlite" file to download it.</s> Scroll downn to [How do I Download and Create the Chinook Database?](https://github.com/lerocha/chinook-database#how-do-i-download-and-create-the-chinook-database), click on [ Downloads page](https://github.com/lerocha/chinook-database/tree/master/ChinookDatabase/DataSources), then on [Chinook_Sqlite.sqlite](https://github.com/lerocha/chinook-database/raw/master/ChinookDatabase/DataSources/Chinook_Sqlite.sqlite)

3. Once the file is downloaded, save it to a directory on your computer where you'll be able to easily access it.
4. If you haven't already done so, download and install SQLite, which is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux systems. You can download it from the official SQLite website at https://www.sqlite.org/download.html.
5. Once SQLite is installed, open a command prompt or terminal window and navigate to the directory where you saved the "chinook.sqlite" file.
6. Type "sqlite3" followed by the name of the Chinook database file (in this case, "chinook.sqlite") and press enter to open the SQLite command prompt with the Chinook database loaded. You should now be able to run SQL queries against the database.

That's it! You now have the Chinook database downloaded and ready to use with SQLite.

We can also use Python, for that. You will need Python 3 installed and `sqlite3`.

```
import sqlite3

# Create a connection to the Chinook database
path_to_database = 'Chinook_Sqlite.sqlite'
conn = sqlite3.connect(path_to_database)

# Create a cursor object to execute queries
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Execute a SELECT query to retrieve all tracks
query = "SELECT * FROM tracks"
cursor.execute(query)

# Fetch all the results and print them
results = cursor.fetchall()
for row in results:
    print(row)
```
