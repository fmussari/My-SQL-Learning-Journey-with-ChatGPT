# My-SQL-Learning-Journey-with-ChatGPT
> SQL, from beginner to expert with ChatGPT

## Introduction
This repository is a documentation of my journey to learn SQL using ChatGPT. I have created this repository to track my progress, document my learning, and showcase how LLMs can be used to accelerate the learning process. The writing of this introduction and the repository creation were both powered by ChatGPT.

You can use a similar approach to learn whatever you want, or at least any programming language you want. Or maybe learn italian cuisine? 

The version used is: [ChatGPT Mar 23 Version](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6825453-chatgpt-release-notes).
