# My-SQL-Learning-Journey-with-ChatGPT

## 1. Creating the repository

The first step was to tell ChatGPT my intentions. I used the following promt:

**Me:**  
I want to learn SQL, so I'm going to ask you for help, but I want to document the whole process in a github repository so I want to start by creating the repository, would you help me?

**ChatGPT:**  
Sure, I can help you create a GitHub repository to document your SQL learning journey. Here are the steps you can follow:

1. First, sign in to your GitHub account or create a new account if you don't have one already.

2. Once you're signed in, click the "+" button in the top right corner of the GitHub dashboard and select "New repository" from the dropdown menu.

3. On the "Create a new repository" page, enter a name for your repository, such as "My SQL Learning Journey".

4. Optionally, you can add a description for your repository, choose whether it should be public or private, and select a license for your repository. You can also choose to initialize the repository with a README file and/or a .gitignore file if you wish.

5. Click the "Create repository" button to create your repository.

6. Once your repository is created, you can clone it to your local machine using Git. To do this, copy the URL of your repository from the GitHub web page and open a terminal on your local machine.

7. Navigate to the directory where you want to store your repository and run the following command:

```
git clone <repository URL>
```

Replace "<repository URL>" with the URL of your repository.

8. Once the repository is cloned to your local machine, you can start adding files to document your SQL learning journey. For example, you can create a README file to provide an overview of your learning goals and a list of resources you plan to use. You can also create subdirectories for each topic you cover, and add SQL scripts, notes, and examples to each directory.

9. Once you've made changes to your local repository, you can push them to your remote repository on GitHub using Git. To do this, run the following commands:

```
git add .
git commit -m "Commit message"
git push
```

Replace "Commit message" with a brief description of the changes you've made.

That's it! You now have a GitHub repository to document your SQL learning journey, and you can continue to add files and update your repository as you learn more about SQL.
